Similar to what we did in the previous episode, we can apply graphical transformations to spectrograms, too. We take [Jean Francois Charles'](https://cycling74.com/tools/charles-spectral-tutorials) ideas on transforming spectrograms into Jitter matrices and back, and fiddle around with it. You can look up the details of the process there, because we're only interested into the graphics stuff here.
